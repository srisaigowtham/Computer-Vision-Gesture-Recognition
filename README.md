# Computer-Vision-Gesture-Recognition
Gesture recognition using computer vision techniques. Simple gestures (closed fist, one to five fingers) are recognized. This was done as part of a course taken - Image Processing/Computer Vision.


This project was done using MATLAB. Though modern gesture recognition using computer vision has many robust features, my project does very basic gesture recognition. It needs a few pre-requisites for the program to work well.

* Good Lighting conditions
* User wearing Full sleeved shirt which has significantly different color than skin
* User should place their hand at the same level as that of their face (This could be improved)

See the pictures for better understanding

-->Source code can be found inside Final Project folder
-->Output for various gestures can be found in seperate folders inside Final Project folder
-->Inside output folders, all the image results shown are outputs at the end of steps followed in the algorithm.
